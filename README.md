# BlogWebsite
A Fully functional web application 
created using Django framework where users can register and post blogs, also users can 
like and comment on blogs.
If the category of the blog is not present so the user can add a new category and can see all the post for a particular category.
A user can also make his/her profile and represent on the profile page and can update his/her profile.
Authentication is also used in this project so that the unauthorized user can only see the post and can not commit any changes.
